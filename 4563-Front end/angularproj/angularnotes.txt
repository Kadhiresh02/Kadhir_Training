*Angular :
-it is javascript framework
-it provide designing and development platform for creating single page application.
-latest version of Angular is 18
-Angular is developed and maintain by Google

s/w pre-requisit
-nodejs
    node -v
-ts
    tsc -v
-angular
    -angular
        ng --version   //it will display angular version

install Angular:
    npm i -g @angular/cli  //it will install angular
    ng new projectname  //it will create angular project 


*how to create angular project
    s-1: ng new projectname

    s-2: cd projectname

    s-3:ng serve or ng s

    s-4:got to browser url and write localhost:4200

-angular work on component
 -component:it is partial part of angular project,
            -it contain code for angular project,
            -it can be any part of project,which we can reuse multiple time

 -in angular root component name is app 

*how to create component in angular
ng generate component componentname
or
ng g c componentname

-when we create component in angular it generate four file
html,css,ts,spec.ts



ng g c databinding

ng g c directive

-how to get output of individual component
- got to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want

*databinding: gettig or accessing data from one file to another file in same component
1.interpolation{{}}:in this send data from ts file =>html file.
2.property binding[]:in this we set attribute(propwerty) values ts=>html.
3.event binding[]:in this we sent data from html=>ts file
4.two-way databinding[()]:in this we can send data from ts <=>html
    -to perform two-way databinding we have ngModel directory but ngModal directive is not part of core angular module it is part formsModule,for thiswe have to import formsModule in component.ts file in import array 

task-1 toggle single image

task-2 togle multiple images

*directive in Angular
  -it is use to change appearance and behaviour of as well as perform DOM manipulation in Angular
  -there are three types of directives in angular
    1.structural directive: it is use to perform DOM manipulation in angular
                            -structural directive denoted by *
                            - structural directive are *ngIf,*ngFor,*ngSwitchCase
                            -we can apply one directive at a time single element
                            -it is part of common module ,for this first we have to import comman in component.
        -ng-template display output on the basis of condition
        - to create reference variable in angular we use #

    2.attribute directive: it is use to change appearance and behaviour of DOM
        -ngStyle:it is use to apply css style property on hte basis of condition
        -ngClass:it is use to apply class on the basis of condition
        -ngModel:it is use to perform two-way databinding


    3.custom directive: the directive created by developer
            ng g diretive directivename


ng g c parent
ng g c child

*use of template refferance variable

*component interactoion :
accessing data from parent component to child component
 -Input() decorator : it is use to send data from parent component to child component
 -Output() decorator : it is use to send data from child component to parent component

*Pipes:
- it is use to  transform property value without changing its original value
- it is denoted by | sign 
- to use pipe need to import commonmodule

- there are three types of pipes in angular
1. inbuilt pipes :pipe provided by angular
2. custom pipe : pipe created by developer for particular use
3.thirdparty pipe: pipes already developed by third party vendor ,first we have to install it and then use it 


ng g c mypipes


1. inbuilt pipe:
    -string pipe 
    -json pipe
    - number pipe
    - currency pipe
    -date pipe
2. custom pipe
 ng generate pipe pipename

 ng generate pipe shared/customPipe/cube 



 *how to use bootstrap in angular
s-1:npm i bootstrap
s-2:go to angular.json file and in its style array import its path
s-3:restart angular project

layout folder
    Nav,pagenotfound,maindashboard,footer,login
    ng g c layout/nav
form folder
    angform,utdf,rtf


*Routing in Angular:
-navigation of component
-to display component output or navigating by using routing in angular for it we write code in app.routes.ts file

-in angular all routing component will display its output below
<router-outlet></router-outlet> directory


1.naming routing:
2.default routing:
3.re-direct routing:
4.parameterize routing:
5.child routing:
6.wild-card routing:

*how to navigate  in angular
- to perform component navigating we have to use routerLink property with anchor tag ,but first we have to import routerLink component in ts file from "@angular/router" library



*angular form
    -there are two types of forms 
        1.UTDF(User deriven Form):
          -when we have create simple form validation in that  we use it
          -to perform validation we have to use ngModel directory with input element
          -in this ngForm directory will hold data of all element in it 
          -in utdf form validation code reside in html file

        2.RTF(Reactive Template Form):
          -when we have to write complex logic to perform form validation in that case we use it
          -to use rtf form validation first we have to import ReactiveFormModule from formsModule in component
          -in rtf we write form validation code in ts file 
          -in this we use mainly two classes 1.FormGroup 2.FormControl
          
          -FormGroup: - it will hold information of all input element
          -FormControl :- it will hold information of individual input element


*service in Angular
- in angular service is special class with extra power 
- it is use for multiple uses
    1.to share data with multiple component
    2. we can implement bussiness logic in it
    3. we can perform external communication (database connection)

*how to create service 
  ng g service serviceName

  ng g service shared/services/itemsservice

*How to access data from service into angular component
- if you want to access service data into angular for this first we have to import sevice in component ts file and create instance of service class




*REST fake API 
-CRUD

cd src/app/shared/database (enter)
npx json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json (enter0)

ng g service shared/services/dbservice


*how to make API request from Angular to server
-to send request from angular service to server for this we have create instance of HttpClient class in service, but HttpClient class is not part of core angular it is part of HttpClientModule, so first we have to import HttpClientModule module.

*React:
	- it is javascript library
	- it is use to create rich user interface
	- it create single page Application(SPA)


*Tecnology pre-requisit
	-html,css.javascript(basic js, ES5 and ES6 ,oops);

*software pre-requisit
	-nodejs
		node -v ---to check node is there are not
		npm -v
	-editor(Vs code)


*how to create react project
 there are three ways to create react project
1.by using npm:  need to install configuration file

	s-1:npm install -g create-react-app
	s-2:create-react-app appname
	s-3:cd appname
	s-4:npm start

2.by using npx:  no need to install configuration file

	s-1:npx create-react-app appname
	s-2:cd appname
	s-4:npm start

3.by using vite:  it create project with minimum package


*how to start react project 
npm start
*hoe to display react project
 http://localhost:3000  

 *react folder structure
 - node_modules : all the dependencies and dev-dependencies will install in this folder
 - package.json : all dependencies entry will found 
 - package-lock.json : detail description of file you will found here
 - README.md : it is guide file how to use react project.
 - public :it contain static data and idle in it

*react is component basis Tecnology
	-component :it is partial part of react project
				- which we can reuse throughout react project
				- it can be any part of react project

- in react App.js is root component
- in react we have two types of component
	1. function component: when your main focus is on UI design
	2.class component: when you have to implement complex logic in that case we use it

* how to display component output

*JSX(Javascript+XML) :
 - it allows us to write html code in react
 - it makes react code easy , in jsx we have wrap multiple element inside one parent element
 - parent element must be any block element like div,h1-h6,p,etc..,



 *props : 
 - it is parameter or functional parameter which is use pass data inside component
 - props return data in object format
 - we can access props in function component by writting props.propsName.
 - we can access props in class component by writting this.props.propsName



 KadhirFunComp (fc) : 
 KadhirFunComp (fc) :write props with fname,laname,salary,gender,address and display its values

 EventComp(cc);
 *method and events in react
 *state :
  - it is use to handle essential in class component
  - it return us object type of data
  - in class component we write state inside constructor

  - if you want to use state in function component for that we use  useState Hook


*setState: it is use to manipulate state inside class component

  MyStateComp(cc);

  Task: create a class component with name MyCounterComp having state with property count=0, yt



  *Bootstrap:

  *how to use bootstrap in react

  by downloading 

  s-1: npm i bootstrap
  s-2: go to index.js and import its path
  import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
  s-3: use bootstrap classes


 render : display component output or view on browser
*Conditional Rendering :
 -display component on the basis Conditional
 1.use  of if else : if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block


















 *how to use css in React
 - there are three ways to use css
 1.internal css:
 2.external css:
 3.module css: -it is use when we have write design for particular component
				- we save file with filename.module.css

*Fragment in react:
	- it is an alternative option for jsx
	- it remove unwanted element from DOM heirarchy
	


*component Interaction
 -accessing data from parent component to child
 - while performing component Interaction in between component they must have parent child relation
 - how establish parent child relation in between component , first we have to import child component in parent component and then write child component name as tag in parent component

*passing state as props
*passing function data as props

*Parent Comp(cc):
 

 *PureComponent:

 - it is use to prevent un-necessary re-rendering class component by performing shallow comparision
 - to achive this we have to extend class component with PureComponent class

 *React.Memo():
  - it is use to prevent un-necessary re-rendering class component by performing shallow comparision
  -to achive we have to pass function complex name as argument to React.Memo() method

  MyMemoComp(fc);


*HOC(Higher Order Component):
- when we have to share same bussiness logic with multiple component in that case we use it
- in this we share bussiness logic from function component to class or function component.

MyHocComp(fc);

*ErrorBoundary:

-it is react component which is use to handle error occur in component three while rendering component
- to handle it we use two class component life-cycle method
	1.getDerivedStateFromError(): when error occur in component it execute automatically
	2.componentDidCatch(): it will display error log(error information).

UserComp(fc);


*virtualDOM:

-instead of manipulating browser Dom directly react creates virtual DOM in its memory 
-where it does all the necessary changes before making changes on browser DOM react render the code which needs to be change only
-thats why react is faster

*routing in react 
 - navigation of component




 * how to install 
 npm install react-router-dom@6


 1.createBrowserDOM() :- it is a method takes array of type of data
					   - in its object we use two property path, element
					   - in htis method we define all types of routing
 2.RouterProvider(): it helps us to render output of all routing component on browser



*tyoes of routing
	1.naming routing:display component o/p after writting component routing path name in browser url
	2.default routing:display component o/p without routing path name
	3.parameterize routing: display component o/p after passing parameter with routing path name
	4.child routing: display one routing  inside another routing
		-to perform child routing we use children property in object which array of object values
		- to display child routing o/p we have to add <Outlet> library
	5.wild-card routing:when user write wrong path name in browser url then we decide what component o/p should display
	  - 

 in src folder
	- MainRouting folder
		-routing.js file
	- layout folder
		-NavComp(fc)
		-FooterComp(fc)
		-LoginComp(fc)
		-MainDashboardComp(fc)
		-PageNotFoundComp(fc)

	-Hooks folder
		ReactHooksComp(fc)
		UseStateHookComp(fc)
		UseEffectHookComp(fc)

*how to create layout for react project
 



*Class component Lifecycle method
 -it comes with four phases
	1.Mounting phase: when component initialize
		-constructor:when clas object initialize constructor get execute automatically
		-getDerivedStateFromProps:it is static method which execute automatically and it is use to set value comng 
		-render:it is responsible to render component data
		-componentDidMount: it will execute immediatly after render method

	2.Update phase:when DOM manipulation is done
		-shouldComponentUpdate: it decide whether component will Update or not
				- it return boolean 
		-getSnapShotbeforeUpdate:it return previous data of props and state before updation of it 
		-render: it is responsible to render component data
		-componentWillUpdate:it will return updated values of state and props

	3.Unmounting phase:when component is deleted
	- componentWillunmount:it just call before component deleted ,it is use to disconect component connection with other component
	4.Error phase:
	-setDerivedStateFromError(): it execute automatically when error occur in component
	-componentDidCatch(): it return error log

* Extension:React/Redux/Typescript/Javascript/Omi snippets
- rfce :create normal function component
- rafce :create arrow function component 
- rce : create class component
- rconst : it create constructor with super method and state

MyFavColorComp.js(cc);

*Hooks in react:
-it allows us to use class component feature in function component.
-by using hooks we can use state in function component
-in react hooks introduce in react version-16


*rules to use hooks
-Hooks work only in function component
-Hooks always use in top-level component
-hooks can not be render conditionaly

1.useState Hook:
2.useEffect Hook:
3.useContext Hook:
4.useRef Hook:
5.useReducer Hook:
6.useCallback hooks:
7.useMemo hooks:


*useState Hook:
- if

-coverage :it is tracking process it will  tell us how much code cover while performing testing


*how to generate test coverage file
	s-1: go to package.json and write in script tag

			"coverage":"jest --coverage --watchAll"
		}
	s-2:in  package.json file add jest coverage nodejs
		   "jest":{

*Redux:
-it is used to store, manage and track state for javascript Application
 (or)
-it is predictable state container for javascript

- redux work on three core principle
1.store(Bank): it is use to store state in it
2.action(withdraw,deposit,transfer) : it is simple statement which we are going to perform
3.reducer(cashier): it is actually carryout state transition depending on state and action and it return new state



*react project
*redux library
	-reduxtoolkit
*react-redux library:it is use to connect react app with redux or reduxtoolkit


* how to install reduxtoolkit
	npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
how to install react-redux library
	-npm install react-redux

reduxCode folder 
 -api folder
 	apiSlice.js
 -store.js file



 *useDispatch(): in function component if you want to access or call action from redux for that we use it
 *useSelector(): it allows us to access state from redux

 *JWT token
 *common functionality

*javascript
  - it is used  to add functionality into webapp.
  - it is interpreted language.
  - it is loosely typed language.


why js is called loosely typed language
    - when we create a variable in js we can not determine what type of data it contain until and unless initialize it
    - in a js variable we can store multiple type of data in it 

how to use js
    - ther are two ways to use js
        1.internal javascript: in html file we use script tag and in that we write js code
        2.external javascript : in this we create seperate js file and import that js file in html file by using script tag.

how to get output in javascript

1.document.write():it will display output in html page . it will display output in same line
2.window.alert(): it will display output in modal popup window
3.console.log(): it will display output in browser console or in terminal
4.innerHTML(DOM): it will display output inside an element.

*hoisting :moving variable and function declaration at top of the web page.




*variable :it is use to store data in it 
          - we can create variable in js by using var,let,const

1. var : - it create function scope variable
         -we can use variable before its declaration
         - we can re-declare variable

 //use of var
        var mydata; //variable declaration
            mydata="Changepond"; //variable initialization
        var name="Kadhir"; // defining a variable


2.let :it create block scope variable
       - we can not use variable before its declaration
       - we can not re-declare variable

3. const : - it create blockscope variable
           - we can not use variable before its declaration
           - in this when we declare a variable at same time we have initialize it
           - its data will never change on run time
 

* special operators
  -exponentiation(**): it retuns power of any number


  - ==(equal to):
    -it check data only and if both are same it return true value
    -ex:
        5==5
        true
        5=='5'
        true
  - ===(exactly equal to):
    -it will check value as well as its data type and if both are same then it will return true value
    - ex:
        5===5
        true
        5==='5'
        false


*DOM manipulation


*function:
    - it is block of code which is used to perform specific task
    - function will execute only when we call it

* there are two types of functions
    1.pre defined function: provide by js to use
    2.userdefined function :user developed for particular use

Syntax:
function functionName(){
  //logical code
}

functionName();




*how to change attribute value by using DOM
*how to call function by using event
*how to access data from input control

*Array : - it is used to store multiple values with same data type.
         - in array data store on index basis
         - array index always start from zero
         - we can access array values outside by writing arrayname[indexnumber]
* Arraymethod


*object : - it is use to store multiple values with different data type
          - in object data store in key and value paired format
          - we can access object data outside of by writing object.keyname.
          - object type of data is mentioned by {}


Task: create array of object for 10 employee hav keys id,name,post,salary,gender,age,city,state
1.display all 10 employee information
2.display employee information who is manager
3.display information of all employee whose gender is female
4.display information of all employee whose age >55
5.display information of those employeewho belong to tamilnadu state



*callback function : passing a function name as an argument inside another function is called callback function

*Date and Time 
  - if we want to display date and time in js first we have object of date class
  - Date object return information from browser

let objectName=new Date();



*form Validation :
  - checking user entered data is correct or wrong
  

  task:
  perform validation for password, email, contact,gender

* String and its method
String  : -it collection of characters
          - in string every character has index value and it start from zero
          - in string blank space also considered as character.

-there are three method which index of searching string
1.indexof(searchingStreing,startIndex);
  - it will search string from left to right and return index of first occurences of string
  - if searching string is not found then return -1 as result

2.lastIndexof(searchingStreing,startIndex?);
  -it will search string from right to left and return index of first occurences of string
  - if searching string is not found then return -1 as result

3.search(searchingString)
   - it will search string from left to right and return index of first occurences of string
  - if searching string is not found then return -1 as result
  - it is faster than indexof method

-there are three method which return part of searching string
1. slice(statrIndex , endIndex?);
  - it will return part of string from big string
  - if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right
  - if we write -ve index then will search index from right to left

2. substring(statrIndex , endIndex?)
  - it will return part of string from big string
  - if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right

3. substr(startIndex,totalNumberOfCHaracters);
  - it will return part of string from big string
  - if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right 

  charAt(index): it return character from index number
  charCodeAt(index) :it use to return ASCII

  replace():
  replaceAll():

  *split(seperator) it is used to string data into array

  task :

  *prompt:
  it generate one popup window and allows use to insert value in it

  *setTimeOut:it call another method only one after particular time interval
  *setInterval:it call another method multiple time after particular time internal


  *ES-5(ECMA script-2009)

  - forEach
  - map
  - filter
  - every 
  - some
  - reduce/reduceRight

  ES-6(EMCA script-2015)

  - let ,const
  - **

  *how to merge two or more array values 
  spread , concate


  * destructuring :creating constant variable to store data in it
    - we can destructure array and object values.
